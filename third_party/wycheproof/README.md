Imported wycheproof test vectors from https://github.com/google/wycheproof.

It is currently necessary to copy these files because, as noted in
https://golang.org/issue/31866, there is currently no general method for a Go
program to locate testdata stored in another module.
The decision process was discussed in the thread here:
https://b.corp.google.com/issues/128930950
